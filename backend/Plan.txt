I want to create a LMS website in MERN stack, what backend routes I need to create for it?

I'm planning to design backend first, and then frontend, since I'm completely blank about the design right now

Designing the backend first for your Learning Management System (LMS) in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) is a solid approach. The backend is crucial because it will handle user authentication, courses, assignments, progress tracking, and other key features of the LMS. Here's a list of potential backend routes and APIs you'll need to build for your LMS:
1. Authentication and Authorization Routes

These routes will handle user login, registration, password management, and JWT-based authorization.

    POST /api/auth/register
    Register a new user (students, instructors, admins).

    POST /api/auth/login
    Login with email and password and return a JWT token.

    POST /api/auth/logout
    Logs out the user (invalidate JWT token).

    POST /api/auth/forgot-password
    Send a password reset email.

    POST /api/auth/reset-password
    Reset password after validation (typically requires a token from the email).

2. User Profile Routes

These routes will handle user details and profile management.

    GET /api/users/me
    Get the current authenticated user’s profile details.

    PUT /api/users/me
    Update the authenticated user’s profile (e.g., name, email, avatar).

    GET /api/users/

    Get a specific user’s details (admin or instructor-only access).

3. Role Management Routes (Admin only)

Admins will have special access to create, update, or delete users with different roles (students, instructors).

    POST /api/users
    Create a new user (Admin).

    PUT /api/users/

    Update user details (Admin).

    DELETE /api/users/

    Delete a user (Admin).

4. Course Routes

The main functionality of an LMS revolves around courses. You'll need to create, update, list, and manage courses.

    GET /api/courses
    Get a list of all courses.

    POST /api/courses
    Create a new course (Instructor/Admin).

    GET /api/courses/

    Get details of a specific course.

    PUT /api/courses/

    Update course details (Instructor/Admin).

    DELETE /api/courses/

    Delete a course (Instructor/Admin).

5. Lesson Routes

Lessons are individual sections/modules of a course.

    GET /api/courses/
    /lessons
    Get all lessons for a specific course.

    POST /api/courses/
    /lessons
    Add a new lesson to a course.

    GET /api/lessons/

    Get the details of a specific lesson.

    PUT /api/lessons/

    Update a lesson (Instructor/Admin).

    DELETE /api/lessons/

    Delete a lesson (Instructor/Admin).

6. Enrollment Routes

These routes will manage the enrollment of students into courses.

    POST /api/enrollments
    Enroll a student into a course.

    GET /api/enrollments
    Get a list of courses the current user (student) is enrolled in.

    DELETE /api/enrollments/

    Unenroll a student from a course.

    GET /api/enrollments/

    Get the list of students enrolled in a specific course (Instructor/Admin).

7. Assignments Routes

If your LMS involves assignments, these routes will allow instructors to create and grade assignments.

    GET /api/courses/
    /assignments
    Get all assignments for a specific course.

    POST /api/courses/
    /assignments
    Create a new assignment for a course.

    GET /api/assignments/

    Get the details of a specific assignment.

    PUT /api/assignments/

    Update an assignment (Instructor/Admin).

    DELETE /api/assignments/

    Delete an assignment (Instructor/Admin).

    POST /api/assignments/
    /submit
    Submit an assignment (Student).

    GET /api/assignments/
    /submissions
    Get all submissions for an assignment (Instructor/Admin).

    POST /api/assignments/
    /grade
    Grade a student’s assignment (Instructor).

8. Quizzes and Exams Routes

Quizzes and exams are another type of assessment in an LMS.

    GET /api/courses/
    /quizzes
    Get all quizzes for a specific course.

    POST /api/courses/
    /quizzes
    Create a new quiz for a course.

    GET /api/quizzes/

    Get quiz details.

    POST /api/quizzes/
    /attempt
    Attempt a quiz (Student).

    GET /api/quizzes/
    /attempts
    Get all quiz attempts (Instructor/Admin).

    POST /api/quizzes/
    /grade
    Grade a student's quiz (Instructor).

9. Progress Tracking Routes

Track the progress of students through the course.

    GET /api/courses/
    /progress
    Get a student's progress for a specific course.

    GET /api/users/
    /progress
    Get the overall progress of a user across all courses.

10. Notifications and Announcements Routes

You’ll likely need a way for instructors or admins to send notifications to users.

    POST /api/notifications
    Create a new notification or announcement.

    GET /api/notifications
    Get all notifications for the authenticated user.

11. File Upload Routes (Optional)

If your LMS allows file uploads (e.g., course materials, assignments), you'll need to handle that.

    POST /api/upload
    Upload a file (for course materials or assignments).

    GET /api/files/

    Get the file (course material, submission).

    DELETE /api/files/

    Delete a file (Instructor/Admin).

12. Payment Routes (Optional)

If your LMS includes paid courses, you'll need to handle payments.

    POST /api/payment/checkout
    Create a payment session for course enrollment.

    GET /api/payment/confirmation
    Confirm the payment (e.g., using a payment gateway callback).

13. Admin Dashboard Routes

Admins need to manage users, courses, and see analytics.

    GET /api/admin/dashboard
    Get the admin dashboard data (e.g., total users, total courses).

    GET /api/admin/users
    Get a list of all users (Admin).

    GET /api/admin/courses
    Get a list of all courses (Admin).

General Considerations

    Database Models:
        User (name, email, role, password, etc.)
        Course (title, description, instructor, lessons, etc.)
        Lesson (title, content, courseId, etc.)
        Assignment (title, due date, courseId, etc.)
        Quiz (title, courseId, questions, etc.)
        Enrollment (userId, courseId)
        Progress (userId, courseId, completed lessons, assignments, etc.)

    Authorization:
    Use middleware to protect routes based on roles (e.g., student, instructor, admin). A user should only have access to routes that match their role.

    Error Handling:
    Make sure to have proper error handling and validation for each route.

    Testing:
    Make sure to write unit tests for your routes, especially around authorization, validation, and business logic.

This list of routes provides a solid foundation for your LMS backend. Depending on your specific requirements, you can add more features such as course certificates, social learning features, live chat, etc. But this should give you a good starting point.
